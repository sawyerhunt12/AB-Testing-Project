# AB-Testing-Project
In this project, I compare two ad campaign groups, a control and test group, and use statistical tests to determine if the two groups are statistically different.

For visualizations, I used the seaborn package. For statistical tests, I used scipy.stats.

Code, questions, hypotheses, and answers to the questions can all be found in the .ipynb file. The data is sourced from Kaggle, link in the first code block.

control_group.csv - data for the control campaign
test_group.csv - data for the test campaign
